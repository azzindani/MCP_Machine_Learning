"""Combined HTTP entry point — all 3 tiers in ONE process, ONE port.

Each tier (basic/medium/advanced) keeps its own server.py for stdio /
individual-HTTP use (LM Studio "add one tier" installs, local dev). This
file is Docker/remote-deployment-only: it imports each tier's already-built
FastMCP instance and mounts its HTTP app at its own path prefix inside one
Starlette app, so pandas/numpy/scikit-learn/xgboost load ONCE instead of
three times. Each tier's own /health, /version, and /mcp routes (added via
@mcp.custom_route in its own server.py) come along for free under the
mount prefix — nothing tier-specific is duplicated here.

Lifespans do NOT propagate through Starlette's Mount() automatically, so
each tier's session-manager lifespan is entered explicitly via
AsyncExitStack — verified live before wiring this up for real (see
project memory / commit history for the throwaway prototype that proved
this against 2 real tiers before committing to the pattern).

# unified server sits behind Caddy on a public hostname forwarded via
# `header_up Host {host}`, so that check rejects every real remote request with
# a 421 "Invalid Host header" -- healthy container, working /health, and every
# tool call refused. Caddy is already the trust boundary, so disable it for the
# mounted sub-apps. Same fix as MCP_Microsoft_Office, which hit this first.
