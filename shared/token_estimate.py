"""Report what a response actually costs, instead of a number typed in by hand.

Every tool returns `token_estimate`, and CLAUDE.md defines it as
`len(str(response)) // 4`. Across this repo it was a literal instead: **101**
occurrences of `"token_estimate": 15` and friends, the largest count in the
fleet, none of them measured.

Under-reporting is the direction that hurts. A client budgets its context from
this number and *admits* the response on the strength of it, so an
order-of-magnitude undercount blows the ~12,000-token budget these servers are
designed around. Error responses are the worst case: their length is dominated
by a variable-length message, so any constant is wrong by construction -- and
*improving* a message by making it more specific silently makes the lie bigger.

Measured on the live fleet before this was written: a `read_document` refusal
naming the timestamp route returned `"token_estimate": 15` for a response of
~205. `restore_version`'s "No backups found" returned 20 for ~100. This repo
is the one whose read_receipt already computes the field correctly (it
returned 258 on a real response), which is exactly why a blanket literal
elsewhere is so easy to miss -- some responses here are honest already.

MCP_Math is the only repo that got this right, in `src/engine/formatter.py`.
This is the same choke point, adapted: 101 hand-edits would drift out of step
with the responses the way the literals already have.

`measure_responses(mcp)` is applied once per server, after the tools are
declared, and changes no tool body. It wraps the tools the manager has already
registered rather than the `@mcp.tool` decorator, so it does not matter whether
it sits above or below the declarations -- a decorator wrapper would have to
precede every one of them and would silently miss any tool added above it.

On fastmcp 2.x the object bound to the module-level name IS the entry in
`_tool_manager._tools`, so wrapping `.fn` is also what the tests see when they
call `mod.some_tool.fn(...)` directly. That is deliberate: a fix the test suite
dispatches around is a fix nobody can hold to account.
